                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Ishraq Khan and I am currently a first-generation college student majoring in Computer Science at Macaulay Honors College at CCNY. I decided to pursue this field after struggling to find passion in pre-med, which was a path that my parents wanted me to be on, but not one I could happily devote the rest of my life to.</p>
                <p>Wanting to get away from the rote memorization that defines many science courses and really focus on creative problem solving instead, computer science made the most sense to me. And it was during a Research Internship at that I was able to really put that skill into practice. I learned about mobile robotics from the ground up and was able to design and implement a waypoint patrol system on the Turtlebot 2.0 mobile robotics kit. This project served as a prototype for an assistive care robot that can patrol a nursing home and alert nursing staff to any emergencies with the residents.</p> 
                <p>And although this was a rewarding learning experience, it wasnâ€™t until I began my Introduction to Data Science course earlier this past fall that I knew exactly what I wanted to pursue as a career. Data science is part coding, part detective work, and all about making sense of the almost infinite data that surrounds everything we do. My goal is to contribute to a larger cause such as healthcare or education by finding insights in that messy data.</p>
