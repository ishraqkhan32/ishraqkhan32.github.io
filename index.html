  <p>Hi everyone, my name is Ishraq Khan. Welcome to my static HTML website. Here you can learn more about me and why I am interested in becoming a TKH Innovation Fellow under the Data Science Track.</p>

  <h3> My Hobbies </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Coding for fun</li>
    <li>Hiking or talking long walks </li>
    <li>Fitness & taking care of my health</li>
    <li>Reading books about self-development and Middle Eastern history</li>
    <li>Learning how to cook new dishes</li>
    <li>Venturing deep into the Youtube rabbit hole</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> My Future Goals </h3>
  <p> When I was in high school, I thought that my dream was to become a doctor. However, as I began taking classes like Genetics and AP Biology, I realized that what I had thought was my dream, was in fact the dream that my parents had for me. To them, success in America for any Desi child was a career in the medical field, but I soon learned that my passions lied in computer science. And after taking an Introduction to Data Science course this past semester, I knew that I made the right decision. Within three months of graduating with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from City College of New York, I wanted to enter the job field as a data scientist. However because there are very few entry-level positions in data science for college graduates, I would also be happy to work as a software engineer on projects that focus very heavily on working with large amounts of data. After working in the industry for 3-4 years, I plan on going back to school for a Master of Data Science. And after that, it's up to the job market and what positions are available to decide where I end up next. I'm excited for the challenges that come my way! </p>

  <h3> Why I Want to Become a TKH Innovation Fellow </h3>
  <p>Nowadays it isn't enough to just go to college, get a degree, and then apply to jobs after you graduate. Companies look for relevant experience outside the classroom to determine whether you would be a valuable investment to their team. I want to set myself up to be in the best position possible for applying to those jobs. I believe that I have built a strong foundation in the fundamentals of computer science, but now it's time for me to specialize in something that I am very passionate about. By being an Innovation Fellow, I would join a cohort of motivated students under the guidance of professionals who know what it is like to break through the glass ceiling and make it in the tech industry. The structured nature of the program and the support provided would allow me to gain as much knowledge possible over the course of the program. I am excited to tackle the real-world tasks using Python's major data analysis libraries (such as Numpy and Pandas) and learn the in-demand skills needed in any data science position. I would also love to take advantage of the extensive alumni network that I would gain access to. Last but not least, I want to become a fellow because of how TKH's mission resonates with me. I read on the website that the goal of TKH is to "empower and sustain a talent pipeline of technologists, entrepreneurs, and digital leaders, who will uplift their communities out of poverty." One of my biggest goals is to establish generational wealth for my family and to make sure that my parents never have to worry about another bill or payment again. I believe that I have the motivation and the dedication to excel as an Innovation Fellow and can see myself coming back one day to give back in whatever way possible, either as a mentor or industry connection for future students. </p>
